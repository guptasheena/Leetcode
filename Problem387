Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.
Examples:
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.



from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:

        count = Counter(s)

        for key in count:
            if (count[key] == 1):
                return s.find(key). #returns the index of character in string
        return -1
