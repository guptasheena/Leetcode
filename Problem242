Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.
Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.
An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are anagram of each other.



from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s, t):

        res1 = Counter(s)
        res2 = Counter(t)

        return res1 == res2

obj = Solution()
s = "anagram"
t = "nagaram"
print(obj.isAnagram(s, t))






Using sorting:

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s, t):

        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)

obj = Solution()
s = "anagram"
t = "nagaram"
print(obj.isAnagram(s, t))
