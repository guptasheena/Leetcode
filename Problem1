Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):

        helper = {}  # to store [value,index]
        result = []

        for index in range(0, len(nums)):
            key = nums[index]
            compliment = target-key
            if compliment in helper:
                result.append(helper[compliment])
                result.append(index)
                break
            else:
                helper[key] = index

        return result

obj = Solution()
print(obj.twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))


Time and Space complexity = O(n)
