Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Note:
•	Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
•	The result can be in any order.




from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1, nums2):

        count1 = Counter(nums1)
        count2 = Counter(nums2)
        result = []

        for key in count1:
            if key in count2:
                char_count = min(count1[key], count2[key])
                for index in range(0, char_count):
                    result.append(key)

        return result

obj = Solution()
print(obj.intersect([3, 0, 1], [1, 9, 0, 2]))
