Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.
You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.
Example 1:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
Example 2:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
Note:
1.	The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].
2.	The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].
3.	The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.
4.	No duplicates in both lists.

    def findRestaurant(self, list1, list2):

        count2 = {}

        for index in range(0, len(list1)):
            count1[list1[index]] = index

        for index in range(0, len(list2)):
            count2[list2[index]] = index

        minimum = sys.maxsize
        result = []
        for key in count1:
            if key in count2:
                if count1[key] + count2[key] <= minimum:
                    minimum = count1[key] + count2[key]
                    result.append(key)
        return result

print(obj.findRestaurant(["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"],
                         ["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]))
